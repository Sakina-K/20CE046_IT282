        <h1>Web Page Design Principle</h1>
        <p>9 General Priciples of Web Designing are detailed below:</p>
        <p>
            <h2>1. Easy Navigation</h2>
            This is one of the most important features or a principle that you must keep in mind and implement while you are designing a website.
            Easy navigation includes a simple menu layout and the ability to quickly and reliably move through sites. Don’t worry I have some tips for easy website navigation.
            <ul>
                <li>Keep the navigation bar as simple as possible with minimal options</li>
                <li>Avoid too many clicks inside the website</li>
                <li>Mitigate the drop-down menu options</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>2. Responsive design</h2>
            Responsive design means the design of a website/webpage that fits well with all the smartphones, computers, laptops or any display devices irrespective of their aspect ratios. An aspect ratio is the height and width of a display device.
            Some tips for responsive design are:
            <ul>
                <li>Optimize the images</li>
                <li>Ensure buttons can be easily clicked on smaller screens</li>
                <li>Create several prototypes</li>
                <li>Consider a Mobile-first design approach</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>3. Same Color Scheme (Consistency)</h2>
            Users should be able to skim through pages understand what they are about. Keeping the coloring scheme consistent is one of the hardest tasks on the planet. Sometimes the color which we like might not be liked by others. There is often a tradeoff between colors. Make sure that the color you choose is well-liked by others. Some colors might fit well to a certain text and some might not, so maintaining consistency is the key role here.

        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>4. Comfortable UI</h2>
            A user interface is through which the user interacts with the system. It serves as a bridge between the system and the user. If the UI (User Interface) is good then the user would definitely like to spend more time on it. 

        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>5. Contents meet user goals for visiting websites</h2>
            When it comes to finding the right information, a user would not be happy if he/she doesn’t get what they want. Be specific in providing the information.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>
                6. Performance: Quick to show something
            </h2>
            If the performance of the website is too slow, then it’s will create a bad impact on the company of the website. And the uses might stop using the website. Think and act wisely. There are many website testing tools out there, just choose one and test the speed of your website.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>7. Feedback about progress</h2>
            Feedback is a response about the task, process or event after its completion or during its stage of completion. Know what’s going on inside the system or website in this case.
